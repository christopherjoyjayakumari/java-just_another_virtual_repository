Pledge: Your Oath as a Java Survivor ☕🔥

You, the brave soul reading this, also known in the coding underworld as "The One Who Codes", solemnly swear on your crashed IDE, memory leaks, and infinite debugging sessions that:

📌 You shall not fear semicolons, for they separate mere mortals from true coders. 🫡
📌 You shall embrace NullPointerExceptions, for they are the Dementors of Java—inescapable, soul-sucking, and always lurking. 💀
📌 You shall not copy-paste blindly, but when you do, at least pretend you understand it (we won’t judge). 😏
📌 You shall debug with honor, even if it means flooding your code with System.out.println("Why is this not working?!"). 🤬
📌 You shall not compare Java to Python, because seeing Python devs write five lines of code for what takes you fifty will only hurt more. 🐍💔
📌 You shall optimize your code, because deep down, you know that future you will suffer maintaining it. 😵‍💫
📌 You shall accept Java’s identity crisis, from its days as "Oak" to being owned by Sun Microsystems, and now under Oracle’s mighty grasp. 🌳➡️🌞➡️🦉
📌 You shall endure Java interviews, where they'll ask you about public static void main(String[] args) like it’s some ancient prophecy. 📜
📌 You shall survive the corporate world, where Java will go from your worst nightmare to your bread and butter. 🍞
📌 You shall ask ChatGPT for doubts, but not make it your oxygen—because one day, when the internet is down, you still need to write code like a warrior, not a chatbot addict. 💪

And finally, when someone asks you the name of your programming language…

Reader: Java.

Me: You're goddamn right. 😎🔥☕

This is your pledge. May the Garbage Collector clean up your memory leaks, and may your code compile on the first try (someday). 🚀💀
