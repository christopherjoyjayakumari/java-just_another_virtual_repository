Books? 📚 **SURE! BUT FIRST, LET'S TALK REALITY...** 🤔  

If you're not from an Engineering background, **reading books is a MUST** to get a strong foundation. But for my **Engineering brothers and sisters,** we already read **48+ books (or more)** just to get a degree! And what did we get? **Bookworms with no tech jobs.** 🤦‍♂️  

So, this is the time to **STOP READING and START CODING!** 🎯  

🔥 **Rule #1:** Code.  
🔥 **Rule #2:** Code more.  
🔥 **Rule #3:** Still stuck? **CODE AGAIN!**  

It doesn’t matter if your first program takes hours—just **code and code some more** until things start making sense. 🧠💻

## 📖 **RECOMMENDED BOOKS FOR NON-TECH PEOPLE**  

📌 **Oracle's Official Java Book** – (*Because the creators know their stuff*)  
📌 **Head First Java** – (*Fun, interactive, and easy to understand*)  
📌 **Cracking the Coding Interview** – (*For Data Structures & Algorithms*)  

These are **more than enough** to get started. ✅

## 💡 **FOR ENGINEERS / CS GRADUATES / SENIOR DEVS / EVEN RETIRED CODERS...**  

🚀 **CODE OR DIE.** *(Yes, I said it first! 😎)*  

❌ Stop overanalyzing.  
❌ Stop hoarding PDFs.  
❌ Stop waiting for the "perfect moment."  

✅ **Just open your IDE and start coding.**

## 🎯 **FINAL WORDS BEFORE WE START CODING...**  

We’ll **write our first Java program** and go through **every topic step by step**, with my usual **rants & humor.** 😂  

Even if I get a job, I **won’t forget you guys.** We **CODE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.** 💻🔥 **Let’s do this!** 🚀
