# **Introduction: Java â€“ A Long Journey & My Eternal Struggle** â˜•ðŸ’€  

My first programming language? **Python.** Simple, elegant, peaceful. Just type:  
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
No semicolons. No compilation errors. Just pure bliss.  

But no, I didnâ€™t choose peaceâ€”I chose **Java.** Because why have an easy life when you can have **NullPointerExceptions at 2 AM?**

### **Javaâ€™s Identity Crisis** ðŸ¤¡  
Java itself had a rough startâ€”  
ðŸ”¹ First, it was almost named after a **tree.** (Imagine saying, *"I am an Oak Developer."* Sounds like a botanist, right?)  
ðŸ”¹ Then came **Sun Microsystems,** where Java shined bright.  
ðŸ”¹ But now? Itâ€™s under **Oracle.** Meaning, it still confuses developers but now with **licensing drama.**  

And whoâ€™s responsible for this madness? **James Gosling.** The genius who thought, *"Letâ€™s create a language thatâ€™s everywhereâ€”except inside programmersâ€™ brains when they need it the most."*  

Java has traveled a long wayâ€¦ **and so have I.** But while Java evolved, Iâ€™m still stuck thinking, *"Wait, why do I need getters and setters again?"*

### **Why Java? Why Pain?**  
I should have just **stuck with Python.** My friends write **10 lines of Python code** and get placed in companies like itâ€™s a piece of cake. Meanwhile, my **CSE degree is drowning like the Titanic** ðŸš¢, with Java dragging me down like an iceberg.  

At this point, I just want to **escape with a good salary package,** like **Rose with the diamond.** But unlike her, I wonâ€™t throw away the **diamond (a tech job) back into the ocean**â€”because I actually **understand its value.**  

So hereâ€™s my hope: **One day, Iâ€™ll get a job.** And even when I do, Iâ€™ll **keep updating this repository.** Why?  
Because preparation is like **Godzilla vs. Kong**â€”a brutal, never-ending war. But work life? Itâ€™s **Godzilla and Kong teaming up**â€”the same thing you hated, now your partner in crime.  

So whether Iâ€™m struggling as a job seeker or crying in the workplace, **this repository will continue documenting my Java trauma.** Buckle up. The pain is just beginning.
